ListenUp-master
===============

Our android application, Listen-Up!, is targeted at bicycle riders who like to listen to music while they are commuting.

Bikers often have trouble paying attention to auditory signals in their surroundings while biking with headphones on

Our goal is to promote the health and safety of cyclists by handling phone processes for them so they do not need to physically 
touch the device while they are utilizing their vehicle. In addition, we want to notify them in case they unknowingly enter 
into a state of danger.
